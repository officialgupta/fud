f√ºd is an app that lets you organise the items in your kitchen and save food, money and lives. It tracks how you use the food in your kitchen and allows you to quickly donate food you are not going to use to local foodbanks. It also allows you to create shopping lists, compare your wastage to others, interact with the application via text, see recipes for the available food and share your stats with others. The datasets used include the expiry dates of foods, recipes for different foods, local foodbanks, and others. The app is created using ruby on rails, haml, sass and javascript.

If visiting the site for the first time, it will redirect you to the login page, where you can create a new account and enter your dashboard.
Upon the dashboard, any of the + links can be used to add items.
